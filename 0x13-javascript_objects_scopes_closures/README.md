## Files

- [0-rectangle.js](0-rectangle.js) - An empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle.

- [1-rectangle.js](1-rectangle.js) - A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with a constructor that takes two arguments `w` and `h`.

- [2-rectangle.js](2-rectangle.js) - A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with a constructor that takes two arguments `w` and `h` and has a condition that creates an instance of `Rectangle` only if both `w` and `h` are greater than `0`.

- [3-rectangle.js](3-rectangle.js) - A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with a constructor that takes two arguments `w` and `h`, has a condition that creates an instance of `Rectangle` only if both `w` and `h` are greater than `0`, and has an instance method `print()` that prints the rectangle using the character `X`.

- [4-rectangle.js](4-rectangle.js) - A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with a constructor that takes two arguments `w` and `h`, has a condition that creates an instance of `Rectangle` only if both `w` and `h` are greater than `0`, and has instance methods `print()` that prints the rectangle using the character `X` and `rotate()` that exchanges the width and the height of the rectangle and `double()` that multiples the width and the height of the rectangle by `2`.

- [5-square.js](5-square.js) - A class `Square` that defines a square and inherits from `Rectangle` of [4-rectangle.js](4-rectangle.js) with a constructor that takes one argument `size`.

- [6-square.js](6-square.js) - A class `Square` that defines a square and inherits from `Square` of [5-square.js](5-square.js) with an instance method `charPrint(c)` that prints the rectangle using the character `c` and if `c` is `undefined`, it prints the rectangle using the character `X`.

- [7-occurrences.js](7-occurrences.js) - A function that returns the number of occurrences in a list.

- [8-esrever.js](8-esrever.js) - A function that returns the reversed version of a list.

- [9-logme.js](9-logme.js) - A function that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value.

- [10-converter.js](10-converter.js) - A function that converts a number from base 10 to another base passed as argument.

- [100-map.js](100-map.js) - A script that imports an array and computes a new array.
